    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Dallas May and I'm 21 years old. I was born in Colorado but moved to Utah when I was 1, and I've lived here ever since. I'm the youngest of three siblings, one brother and one sister.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>As an individual with many years under my belt, I've gathered a plethora of skills that aid me in my day to day life. The good news is I would like to share them with you!</p>

        <p>The skills that I am by far the most proud of are my</p>
        <p style="position: absolute;left: 30vw;">HTML</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;background-color: yellow;color: green;">CSS</p>
        <br>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>My sick keystroke skills have gotten me many many jbobs and have made me lots of money.</p>
        <p>If you have any interest, I do private tutoring, you may inquire below</p>
            <form>
                <input type="text" class="input-text" placeholder="Name">
                <input type="text" class="input-text" placeholder="Email">
                <label for="grit" id="grit">Do you have what it takes?</label>
                <br>
                    <select name="grit">
                        <option value="i-have-what-it-takes">I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES</option>
                        <option value="yes">Yes</option>
                        <option value="i-am-weak">I am weak</option>
                    </select>

                <button type="submit" class="submit-button">I'm ready for my future to begin</button>    
            </form>
        
        <p>I'm sorry but I've run out of time to tell you my other skills. You will just have to trust me that they're just as impressive as my HTML and CSS skills.</p>
        
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>As you can tell from the skills section, my career is already very fulfilling. One thing, however, that I've always wanted to do is create a website, so hopefully I can accomplish that at least before I turn 80.</p>
